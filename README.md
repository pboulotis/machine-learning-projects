## **Machine-learning-projects**
- Some machine learning algorithms used for classification, dimension reduction and clustering data.
- authors [zezosarg](https://github.com/zezosarg) & [pboulotis](https://github.com/pboulotis).
- These two python programs where used for the exercises for the course named "MYE002- Machine Learning" and are based on two different Kaggle competitions.
- Both the descriptions (Homework.pdf) and the reports of the exercises are included (in Greek).
- I recommend reading the report for each exercise before executing the code.
- The two .csv files are needed for the mlset1.py
- In order to execute mlset2.ipynb I recommend using the [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/scratchpad/notebooke0d825ccda/edit).
